# Tree
    Data Structure, is a type of graph, has a root node, each node has child nodes only one parent

# Binary Tree
    When a tree has at the most two children

# Binary Search Tree (BST):
    The values the left children must be less than the parent, and the right children must be higher

# BFS
    Breadth-first search is a way to navigate a graph from an initial vertex by visiting all the adjacent nodes first.

# DFS
    Depth-first search is another way to navigate a graph from an initial vertex by recursively the first adjacent node of each vertex found.

# Examples
    - The HTML DOM, hierarchy of elements
